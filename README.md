## ‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è‚ò¢Ô∏è Warning !! Important Considerations for Development Use:

Please note that this application is intended for development purposes only. It runs on HTTP, not HTTPS, which means it is not yet suitable for production environments. The EC2 instance recommended for this setup is 4GB, which falls outside the AWS free tier due to the significant resources required by pdf.js and Vuetify. Remember to stop your instance after testing to avoid unnecessary charges.

In future updates, we plan to address security by implementing HTTPS and using official domain names for production deployments in AWS. This will enhance the application's security and readiness for real-world use.
